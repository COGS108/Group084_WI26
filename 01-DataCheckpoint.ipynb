    "From 2018,2020,2022,2024 at UC San Diego (UCSD), how do transfer-admit selectivity patterns differ across ten selected majors, and how are these patterns associated with major-level alumni earnings? Using major × year aggregated data, we will characterize selectivity using admitted GPA ranges (converted to midpoint and spread) and admission rates, and we will estimate year-to-year trends for each major. We will then merge in major-level earnings outcomes (25th/median/75th percentile annual earnings and earner counts) for the corresponding year and test whether majors with higher earnings tend to have higher admitted GPA midpoints and/or lower admission rates. Our analysis will use descriptive summaries, trend comparisons, and correlation/OLS regression models (with controls for year, major fixed effects, and applicant volume where available) to assess the strength and significance of these relationships. The final deliverables will identify (1) which majors appear most selective in each year, (2) which majors show the fastest changes in selectivity from 2018,2020,2022,2024, and (3) whether major-level earnings are statistically associated with selectivity measures in this period."

    "Choosing a university major is a crucial decision that impacts a student's academic trajectory and future career prospects. In recent years, there has been increasing attention to the \"return on investment\" of higher education, with prospective students often weighing the academic difficulty of a major against its potential graduate earnings. For transfer students—who typically have more defined career goals upon entering university—the competitiveness of admission (measured by the GPA distribution of admitted students (25th, 50th, and 75th percentiles)) is a primary evaluation criterion. This study uses the University of California, San Diego (UCSD) as a case study, a leading public research university where transfer admission selectivity and GPA thresholds vary significantly across different disciplines.\n",
    "\n",
    "Previous research has confirmed a significant but nuanced link between university admission difficulty and post-graduation earnings. Data from the University of California Information Center suggests this relationship is particularly pronounced at highly competitive institutions like UCSD, especially in fields such as mechanical engineering and computer science, where graduates consistently rank among the highest earners five years after graduation. On the other hand, some \"pre-professional\" majors, such as human biology, maintain high GPA admission thresholds despite potentially lower undergraduate earnings compared to technical fields. This is often because these students go on to pursue advanced medical degrees, indicating that \"admission difficulty\" is not solely determined by current average salaries but also by long-term academic value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Labor market conditions and alumni salary signals have also been shown to influence student demand, and consequently, the academic standards required for admission. It is widely believed that students tend to gravitate towards majors perceived to have higher economic returns, such as STEM fields and applied social sciences like business psychology. This shift in demand leads to increased admission difficulty and higher GPA admission thresholds. For example, UCSD's computer science program consistently maintains higher GPA requirements than humanities disciplines like history, directly reflecting its leading position in alumni earnings data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite these observations, there is a lack of localized research specifically examining the year-to-year changes in UCSD's admission GPA distribution and its correlation with real-time average salary trends for specific majors. While general research suggests that a 10% increase in expected salary increases the likelihood of students choosing a particular major by nearly 14% to 18%, it remains unclear whether these enrollment preferences immediately translate into quantifiable changes in the 25th, and 75th percentiles of matriculation GPA. This project aims to bridge the gap between educational enrollment data and labor market wage signals by analyzing fifteen different majors at the University of California, San Diego (UCSD), spanning fields from history to mechanical engineering."

Fasting idicates the patient hasn't eaten in the last 8 hours.  If blood glucose is >250 or <50 at any time (regardless of the time of last meal) the patient's life may be in immediate danger\"\n",
    "   2. If there are any major concerns with the dataset, describe them. For example \"Dataset is composed of people who are serious enough about eating healthy that they voluntarily downloaded an app dedicated to tracking their eating patterns. This sample is likely biased because of that self-selection. These people own smartphones and may be healthier and may have more disposable income than the average person.  Those who voluntarily log conscientiously and for long amounts of time are also likely even more interested in health than those who download the app and only log a bit before getting tired of it\"\n",

    "Each member is responsible for completing their assigned tasks on time.\n",
    "\n",
    "If someone anticipates difficulty meeting a deadline, they must inform the group as soon as possible so we can adjust responsibilities.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "If a team member becomes unresponsive or does not complete tasks:\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we will check in privately to understand the situation.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the issue continues, we will discuss it as a group.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the problem persists and affects project progress, we will inform the TA and/or professor.\n",

    "## Commitment\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Communicate clearly and respectfully.\n",
