    "From 2018,2020,2022,2024 at UC San Diego (UCSD), how do transfer-admit selectivity patterns differ across ten selected majors, and how are these patterns associated with major-level alumni earnings? Using major × year aggregated data, we will characterize selectivity using admitted GPA ranges (converted to midpoint and spread) and admission rates, and we will estimate year-to-year trends for each major. We will then merge in major-level earnings outcomes (25th/median/75th percentile annual earnings and earner counts) for the corresponding year and test whether majors with higher earnings tend to have higher admitted GPA midpoints and/or lower admission rates. Our analysis will use descriptive summaries, trend comparisons, and correlation/OLS regression models (with controls for year, major fixed effects, and applicant volume where available) to assess the strength and significance of these relationships. The final deliverables will identify (1) which majors appear most selective in each year, (2) which majors show the fastest changes in selectivity from 2018,2020,2022,2024, and (3) whether major-level earnings are statistically associated with selectivity measures in this period."

    "Choosing a university major is a crucial decision that impacts a student's academic trajectory and future career prospects. In recent years, there has been increasing attention to the \"return on investment\" of higher education, with prospective students often weighing the academic difficulty of a major against its potential graduate earnings. For transfer students—who typically have more defined career goals upon entering university—the competitiveness of admission (measured by the GPA distribution of admitted students (10th, 25th, and 75th percentiles)) is a primary evaluation criterion. This study uses the University of California, San Diego (UCSD) as a case study, a leading public research university where transfer admission selectivity and GPA thresholds vary significantly across different disciplines.\n",
    "\n",
    "Previous research has confirmed a significant but nuanced link between university admission difficulty and post-graduation earnings. Data from the University of California Information Center suggests this relationship is particularly pronounced at highly competitive institutions like UCSD, especially in fields such as mechanical engineering and computer science, where graduates consistently rank among the highest earners five years after graduation. On the other hand, some \"pre-professional\" majors, such as human biology, maintain high GPA admission thresholds despite potentially lower undergraduate earnings compared to technical fields. This is often because these students go on to pursue advanced medical degrees, indicating that \"admission difficulty\" is not solely determined by current average salaries but also by long-term academic value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Labor market conditions and alumni salary signals have also been shown to influence student demand, and consequently, the academic standards required for admission. It is widely believed that students tend to gravitate towards majors perceived to have higher economic returns, such as STEM fields and applied social sciences like business psychology. This shift in demand leads to increased admission difficulty and higher GPA admission thresholds. For example, UCSD's computer science program consistently maintains higher GPA requirements than humanities disciplines like history, directly reflecting its leading position in alumni earnings data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite these observations, there is a lack of localized research specifically examining the year-to-year changes in UCSD's admission GPA distribution and its correlation with real-time average salary trends for specific majors. While general research suggests that a 10% increase in expected salary increases the likelihood of students choosing a particular major by nearly 14% to 18%, it remains unclear whether these enrollment preferences immediately translate into quantifiable changes in the 25th, and 75th percentiles of matriculation GPA. This project aims to bridge the gap between educational enrollment data and labor market wage signals by analyzing fifteen different majors at the University of California, San Diego (UCSD), spanning fields from history to mechanical engineering."

    "We hypothesize that higher post-graduation salaries lead to a larger, more competitive applicant pool, causing a measurable increase in admitted transfer GPAs for that major. We expect to see a positive correlation between changes in major-level median salary and changes in GPA selectivity across the observed period.\n",
    "\n",
    "Students tend to choose majors with better employment prospects. However, there is a time lag between observing the job market and actually applying. Students applying for the fall 2024 admission are likely to make their decisions based on the salary levels of the 2021-2022 graduates. At UCSD, many majors have enrollment limit. Therefore, the increase in the number of applicants influenced by the previous high income should lead to an increase in the admission GPA threshold in the coming years. We expect this impact to be most significant in computer science and engineering majors.\n",
    "\n",
    "How we will conduct the test: We will calculate the percentage changes in median salary and the percentile changes in admission GPA. We will conduct a correlation test to determine if the GPA increases more rapidly in professional fields with greater prior salary growth. We will also group the majors by fields (STEM, humanities) and conduct separate regression analyses to examine if there are differences in the relationships between different fields.\n",

    "## Data\n",
    "An ideal dataset would contain individual transfer applicant records from UCSD, each applicant's major, transfer GPA, admission decision, and entry year. This would let us calculate any GPA percentile we need rather than relying on pre-aggregated summaries. These applicant records would be linked to actual wage data. The earnings data would be UCSD-specific. We need four years of data (2018,2020,2022,2024) across fifteen to twenty majors to see real trends, about 100 to 150 total observations. The data would live in a secure database with student privacy protected."

This creates a hard limit, making it impossible to measure further improvements in the strength of top-tier students; Small sample sizes for some majors: Majors with very few enrolling students are susceptible to significant volatility in their GPA averages, as they can be heavily influenced by the data of just one or two individuals.

Though we try our best to choose the represent majors, some rows have very few of UC alumni being recorded, for example, there is only 30 people are recorded in chemistry in 2025-2016 so their salary averages can swing wildly. Also, as for UC San Diego alumni only, the numbers of recorded are way too low beyond measurable, thus hereby we choose the UC wide alumni as representing UCSD alumni, which different schools may have different recognized majors, and this ego effect might also affect the annual salaries one may earned. For example, UCLA’s Visual art -media major is world-wide recognized, thus for when we compared UCSD’s enrollment (the first and previous dataset here) with UC alumni salaries (the second and this dataset here), we can’t reject there is a possibility here that the earning we used here is bit higher than the actual UCSD media major earning.\n",

    "1. Change the header from Dataset #1 to something more descriptive of the dataset\n",
    "2. Write a few paragraphs about this dataset. Make sure to cover\n",
    "   1. Describe the important metrics, what units they are in, and giv some sense of what they mean.  For example \"Fasting blood glucose in units of mg glucose per deciliter of blood.  Normal values for healthy individuals range from 70 to 100 mg/dL.  Values 100-125 are prediabetic and values >125mg/dL indicate diabetes. Values <70 indicate hypoglycemia. Fasting idicates the patient hasn't eaten in the last 8 hours.  If blood glucose is >250 or <50 at any time (regardless of the time of last meal) the patient's life may be in immediate danger\"\n",
    "   2. If there are any major concerns with the dataset, describe them. For example \"Dataset is composed of people who are serious enough about eating healthy that they voluntarily downloaded an app dedicated to tracking their eating patterns. This sample is likely biased because of that self-selection. These people own smartphones and may be healthier and may have more disposable income than the average person.  Those who voluntarily log conscientiously and for long amounts of time are also likely even more interested in health than those who download the app and only log a bit before getting tired of it\"\n",

    "This dataset contains the admission statistics of transfer students from UCSD for the years 2018, 2020, 2022, and 2024, aggregated by major. The data was extracted from the university's institutional research records and provides a view of the selective trends in admission choices across 15 different majors in the fields of humanities, social sciences, life sciences, and engineering. The data structure consists of each row representing a unique combination of major and year, and all fields have been cleaned and validated for consistency.\n",
    "\n",
    "The column of applicants represents the total number of transfer students who submitted applications to the specific major during the admission period, and it is the main indicator for measuring the project's demand. Admissions indicate the number of applicants who were admitted. The admission rate is calculated by dividing the number of admissions by the number of applicants, reflecting the competitiveness from the perspective of the institution's enrollment capacity. The enrollment number counts the number of admitted students who eventually enrolled at the University of California, San Diego. The enrollment rate is calculated by dividing the enrollment number by the number of admissions, reflecting the attractiveness of the admission to this major compared to other institutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our assumption holds that the most crucial indicator is the GPA range. The admission GPA range is expressed by the lowest and highest values (for example, \"3.41 – 3.96\"), which actually represent the middle 50% of the transfer GPAs of admitted students. The lower limit corresponds to the 25th percentile, indicating the GPA required to be a competitive candidate, while the upper limit corresponds to the 75th percentile, showing the GPA of high-performing admitted students. The admission GPA range follows the same structure but reflects the actual admitted students, excluding those who have been admitted to other institutions. \n",
    "\n",
    "This dataset is directly relevant to our hypothesis regarding salary-driven competition. The Admit GPA range, specifically the 25th and 75th percentiles, serves as our primary dependent variable, representing the selectivity threshold we hypothesize will rise in response to strong labor market signals. An increase in applicants in specific major driven by high salary outcomes should force admissions officers to raise the GPA floor. We can observe this by tracking changes in the lower bound of the Admit GPA range over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Several limitations of this dataset should be noted. The data is grouped by major, so we cannot see individual student information like which community college they came from or where they live. Since GPA cannot go above 4.0, competitive majors like mechanical engineering often has upper bound 4.00, so if top students get even stronger, we cannot measure that improvement because the scale has a hard limit. Some majors have very few enrolling students, so their GPA averages can swing wildly based on just one or two people. \n",

The data was extracted from the UC alumni at work, information center website, who collects its’ data from AEO, financial aid and degree data, the USDOE's College Scorecard, National Association of Colleges and Employers (NACE) Survey 2015 and MIT Living wage calculator.Note that the annual salaries here have been adjusted to 2024 dollar, and represents the average annual salaries UC bachelor degree owners earned within 2 years of graduation.\n",

    "This dataset has 15 different majors across the wide fields of humanities, social sciences, life sciences, and engineering. The rows represent a unique combination of major and year, and all fields have been cleaned and validated for consistency. The column of earnings percentile 75, median, and percentile 25, gives us an overall view of how the annual earnings would look like for a student who earned a bachelor in a specific major, didn’t go to any graduate school and work directly for 2 years. Count of Number of Records is the number of UC alumni that are recorded. Which quite matches the reality of engineering students tend and more easily to get a job right after undergrad, while natural science and art degrees are more likely pursuing a higher degree. We also try using the rate of records, which means the count of number of records divided by the overall graduated where we can’t find the specific data of UC alumni numbers in a specific major (only departments’ count).\n",
    "\n",
    "So, 1. for a certain major; (when the median doesn't have a significant change), if the 75% earning goes higher or the 25% earning goes lower, then it means for at least UC alumni, this field might be more promising(more money, more job opening, and possible eaiser internships and recruial). And thus under our H0, there shall be a upward shift in the numbers of studnet who choose this major, 
    "\n",
    "As noted above, the annual earnings here are in unit of adjusted US dollars, which means adjusting the salaries of previous years base on the ratio between the US current that year to 2024 year. The calculation behind it is a little bit complex, basic ideas is to find out how much money you need to spend in that year to buy for example an egg(buying power).

Though we try our best to choose the represent majors, some rows have very few of UC alumni being recorded, for example, there is only 30 people are recorded in chemistry in 2025-2016 so their salary averages can swing wildly. Also, as for UC San Diego alumni only, the numbers of recorded are way too low beyond measurable, thus hereby we choose the UC wide alumni as representing UCSD alumni, which different schools may have different recognized majors, and this ego effect might also affect the annual salaries one may earned. For example, UCLA’s Visual art -media major is world-wide recognized, thus for when we compared UCSD’s enrollment (the first and previous dataset here) with UC alumni salaries (the second and this dataset here), we can’t reject there is a possibility here that the earning we used here is bit higher than the actual UCSD media major earning.\n",
    
    "Please note that you can always keep adding more datasets in the future if these datasets you turn in for the checkpoint aren't sufficient.  The goal here is demonstrate that you can obtain and wrangle data.  You are not tied down to only use what you turn in right now."

    "### A. Data Collection\n",
    " - [ ] **A.1 Informed consent**: If there are human subjects, have they given informed consent, where subjects affirmatively opt-in and have a clear understanding of the data uses to which they consent?\n",
    " - [X] **A.2 Collection bias**: Have we considered sources of bias that could be introduced during data collection and survey design and taken steps to mitigate those?  \n",
    "\n",
    "   Admissions and earnings data may reflect structural inequalities, differences in applicant pools, and labor market demand. These systemic factors may influence observed associations.\n",
    " - [X] **A.3 Limit PII exposure**: Have we considered ways to minimize exposure of personally identifiable information (PII) for example through anonymization or not collecting information that isn't relevant for analysis?  \n",
    "\n",
    "            The dataset contains only major-by-year aggregated statistics and no personally identifiable information.\n",
    " - [X] **A.4 Downstream bias mitigation**: Have we considered ways to enable testing downstream results for biased outcomes (e.g., collecting data on protected group status like race or gender)?  \n",
    "\n",
    "            Because we analyze aggregated data, we cannot evaluate individual-level fairness. We explicitly state this limitation in our discussion.\n",
    "\n",
    "### B. Data Storage\n",
    " - [X] **B.1 Data security**: Do we have a plan to protect and secure data (e.g., encryption at rest and in transit, access controls on internal users and third parties, access logs, and up-to-date software)?  \n",
    "\n",
    "            Data is stored locally on password-protected devices and in a private GitHub repository accessible only to team members.\n",
    " - [ ] **B.2 Right to be forgotten**: Do we have a mechanism through which an individual can request their personal information be removed?  \n",
    "\n",
    "            No individual-level data is collected, so this is not applicable.\n",
    " - [X] **B.3 Data retention plan**: Is there a schedule or plan to delete the data after it is no longer needed?  \n",
    "\n",
    "            Data will be retained only for the duration of the course project.\n",
    "\n",
    "### C. Analysis\n",
    " - [X] **C.1 Missing perspectives**: Have we sought to address blindspots in the analysis through engagement with relevant stakeholders (e.g., checking assumptions and discussing implications with affected communities and subject matter experts)?  \n",
    "\n",
    "            Our analysis does not account for demographic factors, socioeconomic background, or non-monetary educational value.\n",
    " - [X] **C.2 Dataset bias**: Have we examined the data for possible sources of bias and taken steps to mitigate or address these biases (e.g., stereotype perpetuation, confirmation bias, imbalanced classes, or omitted confounding variables)?  \n",
    "\n",
    "            Earnings may reflect broader economic trends, and admission rates may depend on applicant volume. These may confound interpretation.\n",
    " - [X] **C.3 Honest representation**: Are our visualizations, summary statistics, and reports designed to honestly represent the underlying data?  \n",
    "\n",
    "            We report correlations and regression results transparently and avoid causal claims.\n",
    " - [X] **C.4 Privacy in analysis**: Have we ensured that data with PII are not used or displayed unless necessary for the analysis?  \n",
    "\n",
    "            All results are based on aggregated statistics; no individual data is displayed.\n",
    " - [X] **C.5 Auditability**: Is the process of generating the analysis well documented and reproducible if we discover issues in the future?  \n",
    "\n",
    "            All preprocessing and modeling steps are documented in the notebook to ensure reproducibility.\n",
    "### D. Modeling\n",
    " - [X] **D.1 Proxy discrimination**: Have we ensured that the model does not rely on variables or proxies for variables that are unfairly discriminatory?  \n",
    "\n",
    "            Although no sensitive attributes are used, selectivity and earnings may indirectly reflect systemic inequality.\n",
    " - [ ] **D.2 Fairness across groups**: Have we tested model results for fairness with respect to different affected groups (e.g., tested for disparate error rates)?\n",
    " - [X] **D.3 Metric selection**: Have we considered the effects of optimizing for our defined metrics and considered additional metrics?  \n",
    "\n",
    "            We use multiple selectivity measures and regression models rather than relying on a single metric.\n",
    " - [X] **D.4 Explainability**: Can we explain in understandable terms a decision the model made in cases where a justification is needed?  \n",
    "\n",
    "            We use interpretable linear regression models.\n",
    " - [X] **D.5 Communicate limitations**: Have we communicated the shortcomings, limitations, and biases of the model to relevant stakeholders in ways that can be generally understood?  \n",
    "\n",
    "            We clearly state that correlation does not imply causation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### E. Deployment\n",
    " - [X] **E.1 Monitoring and evaluation**: Do we have a clear plan to monitor the model and its impacts after it is deployed (e.g., performance monitoring, regular audit of sample predictions, human review of high-stakes decisions, reviewing downstream impacts of errors or low-confidence decisions, testing for concept drift)?  \n",
    "\n",
    "            This is an academic analysis and not a deployed system.\n",
    " - [ ] **E.2 Redress**: Have we discussed with our organization a plan for response if users are harmed by the results (e.g., how does the data science team evaluate these cases and update analysis and models to prevent future harm)?\n",
    " - [ ] **E.3 Roll back**: Is there a way to turn off or roll back the model in production if necessary?\n",
    " - [X] **E.4 Unintended use**: Have we taken steps to identify and prevent unintended uses and abuse of the model and do we have a plan to monitor these once the model is deployed?  \n",
    "\n",
    "            Findings could be misinterpreted as ranking majors solely by income; we caution against oversimplification."
